As a beginner, its good to check out websites that you really like the layout of and imitate them. And so by going to your favorite website and playing around with it through the inspect option, you can change the logo image or font style, while becoming more familiar with the terminology and the structure of the HTML and CSS files that make up the site itself.

Here are a couple of websites that I think have really nice layouts:

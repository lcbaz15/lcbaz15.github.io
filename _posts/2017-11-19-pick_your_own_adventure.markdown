One takeway from the Object labs is that information coming from a website will always have to be picked apart, and more often than not, every time you do, its going to need a different process. Though its safe to say that the Email Parser is a good starter example simply because we know what to expect from an email address/how the naming structure typically will be, the Anagram Detector suggests that even if the info coming in is intentionally scrambled, there are algorithms to output more legible information. 

All in all, the Labs are varied enough to easily pick your own adventure, seeing the kinds of data one will eventually have to deal with.

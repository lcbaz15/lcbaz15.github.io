There's an ever-increasing desire in the field of architecture to become more efficient, like a robot. Time is money and time is precious, so I can understand the rush to integrate technology into every aspect of the architectural design and construction process. 

And so now, the architect must be able to capably wield the 3D and 2D model and drafting tools at our disposal. But this rapid succession of newness must mean that the architect must also be able to create tools in order to properly solve complex problems that come with the progression of time. Learning how to code is a step in that direction, giving the architect more power and flexibility in this increasingly complex world.

That's my pragmatic reason for wanting to learn how to code and develope softwware one day. 

The real reason for me started when I worked on my thesis project in my final year of architecture. I took the conventional use and meaning of the architectural element of a wall and wanted to reimagine it. The wall inserted with technology that reads movement around it, becomes animal-like as it responds by changing its form. The wall communicates with the outside world, with the user, and is no longer a mute, static object. During my thesis project, I used a visual programming through a software plugin called Grasshopper as well as Processing, and I found that through coding, one could subvert convention and recreate and integrate all kinds of data into model making. 

The end goal is to dematerialize the wall. As the evolution of these wall prototypes progresses, starting from a monstrous physicalization of the architect's will to build and slowly tearing away at the restrictions of architecture itself, like structure and mass, a new understanding will emerge about our true capabilities of creating our worlds, integrating both the real world and an imagined one. Put simply, it would be amazing to find a way to construct worlds with our minds, using the lessons of the real world as a guide.
